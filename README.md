Notes for the NPTEL course Data Science For Engineers

When I took this course, I found no curated material/notes whatsoever to study from. Hopefully, this can help you out a little bit.
The notes are only from Week 1 to Week 3. Feel free to add your notes for further weeks.

These are supposed to be a mere starting point. Kindly do not only rely on them.
